# Chicago widget library

The Chicago widget set is a retro 32-bit desktop design language for Flutter.
It was discussed in the "Building a desktop design language with Flutter"
session in Google I/O 2021.

## Disclaimer

This library is still under very active development. It also relies on very new
features of Flutter and is likely to only work against Flutter on the master
channel.

Specifically, *this library is known to NOT work against Flutter 2.2*, as it
relies on commits that have not yet made it to the stable channel.

## Example

The example directory contains a "kitchen sink" demo of the widgets contained in
the package.

There's also an interactive demo built for the web available at
